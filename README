This repository is dedicated to ongoing coursework for Probability and Applied Statistics, Spring 2024.

Projects are separated into Parent folders. Project 1 is all assignments submitted for the Midterm.

The interfaces and abstracts folder contains interfaces which programs
within the repository implement in different ways. Reference these interfaces
to gain a base understanding of the functions of each program which implements them.

Each separate program is housed within its own folder.

Pokemon Projects contains both the Pokemon TCG Emulation Project, and two "Monte Carlo"
Pokemon Hand Drawing Projects.

Set Operations is a simple program showcasing basic logical set operations on sets of elements.

Stats Library is a program which models many differing types of probability distributions for both
discrete random variables and given probabilities.

Written Work contains a formula sheet, as well as a writeup on uses of the Github Version Control System.

This writeup is supplemented by screenshots of the process to rebase a cloned repository using a specific commit.

See the contents of each package for further breakdown of the data structures, programs, tests,
and documented results of each program.
