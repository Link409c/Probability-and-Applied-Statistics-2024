The Research and Analysis portion of our final project:

1. Pick a Large Data Set.
    The topic can be anything that interests you.
    If you find yourself asking "is this data set large enough"... find a bigger data set.

2. Go through each chapter and each section and write a problem that can be answered with your
   data set. Make it tell a story about your data.

3. Write a report based on your findings. Include figures, equations, works cited.
    Format it to look like a story, not twenty or so problems listed in order.
    Obviously solve every problem.
    Report the results of each problem in English.
