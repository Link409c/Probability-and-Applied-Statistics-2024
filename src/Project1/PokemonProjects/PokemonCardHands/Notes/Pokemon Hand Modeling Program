Interesting rule on the pokemon TCG: you need a pokemon in your opening hand.
Otherwise your opponent gets a free card and you have to reshuffle your deck.
From a hand of 7 cards, and a deck of 60 cards.
Experimenting with drawing hands:
1 Pokemon and 59 energy
What's the probability of drawing the pokemon?

Program:
Make the Card Class
Give it an attribute: Energy or Pokemon
Make the Pokemon Draw Program
It has a Deck of the Card Objects
Populate it with one Pokemon and all other energy
Draw a hand some number of times (100000)
Wrap this in a loop increasing the number of pokemon and decreasing the energy
    1->2 Pokemon, 59->58 Energy etc
    Loop 60 times.
    Plot the results in excel.
Use the program to determine the optimal ratios of pokemon to energy to always draw a pokemon
in your opening hand.
