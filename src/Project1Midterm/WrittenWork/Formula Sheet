Central Tendency

Mean: The average of a set of values.

    µ = ∑x / n

    "The sum of all the values divided by the amount of values"

Median: The middle value of an ordered set of values.

Mode: The most represented value in a set.

Variance: Generally how far away the data can go from the mean.

    σ^2 = ∑(x - µ)^2 / (n - 1)

    "The sum of the square of each difference of every value from the mean,
    divided by one less than the total number of values"

    OR

    The Manual Way:

    a. Find the Mean.
    b. Subtract the Mean from each value.
    c. Square each value found in b.
    d. Add the squares.
    e. Divide by 1 less than the number of values.
        + AKA Find the Variance.
    f. Find the Square Root of the Variance.

Standard Deviation: Measures how close to the mean values tend to be.

    σ = √σ^2

    "The Square Root of the Variance"

Bell Curve AKA Gaussian Distribution AKA Normal Distribution

µ +- σ  = 67%
µ +- 2σ =
µ +- 3σ =

Permutations
    An ordered arrangement of r distinct objects. The number of ways of ordering n
    distinct objects taken r at a time.

    n! / (n-r)!

Multinomial Coefficients
    The number of ways of partitioning n distinct objects into k disjoint subsets of sizes.
    n1, n2, n3, ..., nk

    n! / n1!n2!n3!...nk!
