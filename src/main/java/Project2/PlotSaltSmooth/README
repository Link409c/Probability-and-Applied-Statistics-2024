This project aims to show two different implementations of a program which Plots, Salts, and Smooths data points.

The first implementation is user-defined and programmed without external libraries to provide any functionality.

The second implementation showcases similar applications in plotting salting and smoothing data using Octave.

The third implementation extends each user-defined program, using external APIs from JFreeChart and Apache Math
Commons to define new methods for plotting, salting, and smoothing. These Libraries can also output and display the
data without needing to use Excel.

Each implementation has its own set of results, and each set of results will be compared and analyzed.
