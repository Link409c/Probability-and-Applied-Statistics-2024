This directory contains all files, programs, and reports for the Final Project. Refer to each subdirectory for more
information.

Contents:

Data Set Analysis: Applications of each topic covered in the course examining a data set. Includes a presentation
covering each area, the results, and discussion.

Plotter, Salter, & Smoother: A project showing the process of plotting a function to a graph, adding a salt to
obscure the data, and then smoothing the data using averages to attempt to recognize the original trend in the plot.
Includes two sets of programs and their respective analyses: Programs written by the student, as well as programs
implementing the external libraries Apache Math Commons and JFreeChart. The external libraries offer the functions
the student coded in their own programs as well as the ability to display graphed data without export to another file
or program, such as excel. Finally, a third analysis is included of the use of GNU Octave for Plotting, Salting, and
Smoothing.

Stats Library: Extending the original Stats Library from the Midterm Project, this program covers the final few
distributions we learned in the second half of the course - Poisson Distribution, and Tchebysheff's Theorem.

StocksBot: A program designed to examine the trends in historical data of a stock and make decisions to buy, sell,
or some other actions. Includes the program, its results and a discussion. Stocks data used in testing is included in
the Files directory.

Written Work: Similar to Project 1, Written Work contains a Formula Sheet covering all chapters after the Midterm.
