Writing a new monte carlo simulation. We'll use the existing pokemon deck to do this.

A charizard deck needs to find a rare candy to have a chance at winning.

What if the rare candy isnt in the deck ? ie. it's in the prize pile.

Run the program with 1, 2, 3, and 4 rare candy in the deck.

Find the odds, given a pokemon was in the opening hand, we do NOT draw a rare candy.

Sample Run of the program:

Make a Deck with a number of Pokemon, Energy, Trainers, etc.
Use the optimal amount of Pokemon we found from the first program.
Start the deck with one rare candy.

Draw a hand, and determine 2 things:
    if there is a Pokemon in the hand,
        is there a rare candy in the hand?
            if not, is it in the prizes?
    if there is not a Pokemon in the hand,
        is there a rare candy in the hand?
            if not, is it in the prizes?

Get all these outcomes, and store the information in a data structure to populate an output file.

Then, calculate the probabilities on paper and compare the results.
