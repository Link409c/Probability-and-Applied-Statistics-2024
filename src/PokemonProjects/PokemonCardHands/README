This project aims to determine optimal ratios for cards in a Pokemon Card Deck.

Two scenarios are presented: A Standard Deck for determining Pokemon counts, and
a "Charizard Rare Candy" Deck, for determining conditional probability of drawing
certain combinations of cards.

Associated packages separate user-defined data structures, the programs, testers, and results.

Detailed results are documented in the provided excel sheet.
